# Super-Store-Sales-prediction

The data is of BIGMART which has been collected during the 2013 sales data for 1559 products across 10 stores in different cities.
The aim is to build a predictive model and predict the sales of each product at a particular outlet.
Using this model, we will try to understand the properties of products and outlets which play a key role in increasing sales.
